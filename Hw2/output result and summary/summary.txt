For dataset1:

Before pruning,  accuracy = 76.30%

Post pruning, 1 st attempt:
 K = 0 , accuracy = 76.30%

Post pruning, 2 st attempt:
 K = 3 , accuracy = 75.90%

Post pruning, 3 st attempt:
 K = 5 , accuracy = 76.25%

Post pruning, 4 st attempt:
 K = 8 , accuracy = 76.70%

Post pruning, 5 st attempt:
 K = 10 , accuracy = 76.30%


The best decision tree gets accuracy = 76.70% when K=8, which is to prune 8 nodes.

For dataset2:

Before pruning,  accuracy = 72.83%

Post pruning, 1 st attempt:
 K = 0 , accuracy = 72.83%

Post pruning, 2 st attempt:
 K = 3 , accuracy = 73.83%

Post pruning, 3 st attempt:
 K = 5 , accuracy = 74.83%

Post pruning, 4 st attempt:
 K = 8 , accuracy = 72.83%

Post pruning, 5 st attempt:
 K = 10 , accuracy = 73.17%

The best decision tree gets accuracy = 74.83% when K=5, which is to prune 5 nodes.
